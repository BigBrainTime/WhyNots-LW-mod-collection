Advanced Gates coming soon!

Functional gates so far:
- Half Adder
- Full Adder

Note: Functional does NOT mean final

An alternative mod is https://github.com/mtalyat/Gates-Galore created by BigMintyMitch#1620. We happened to have similar ideas at about the same time and play on a server together so no harsh feelings between our two mods.
